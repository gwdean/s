Notes on Susskind-Hrabovsky-2013.

** Abstract
Susskind-Hrabovsky's /The Theoretical Minimum/ explains
clearly but in depth, the fundamentals of classical 
physics to the (mathematically literate) outsider.
These tools should be ported into the social sciences
and be considered part of the basic sociological 
tool-kit.
