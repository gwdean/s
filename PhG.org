In this text, Houlgate focuses on the first four chapters of the
/PhG/: Sense-Certainty, Perception, Force/Understanding, The Truth of Self-Certainty.
The hope of Houlgate is that after learning how Houlgate interprets
the first 4 chapters, the students can then "fill in the missing details"
from chapters 5 through 8 by themselves.

The aim throughout the work is to explain how the argument of the /PhG/ proceeds,
and why it might be deemed successful. 

Houlgate uses the Miller translation as his main text (in addition to the German).
Houlgate amends the translation whenever he finds it necessary.

***** Perception (1037)
Such a this that continues beyond itself in its negation
Hegel calls a 'universal'. The object of perception is
thus a sensuous universal--red,green,hot,cold,etc. (1058)

The truth is something universal because it is a /this/
that preserves itself in /no longer/ being this. (1058)

Hegel reaches the conception of the object of perception
not by reflection on our everyday perceiving, but by
rendering explicit what is implicit in the experience
of sense-certainty. (1102)

It is important to recognize that Hegel's /derivation/
of the object of perception is wholly immanent: the truth
for perception must take the form of things with properties
because this is what is implicit in the very form of 
emergent truth (1102).

If you spell out what it means for the truth, as object 
of consciousness, to be that-which-is-NOT-just-the-object-
of-immediate-certainty, what you get first are things
with properties. (1102)
