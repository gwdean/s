** Why Lean?
*** DOTWIMPP: The Eight Deadly Wastes
**** Defects
Lean focuses on preventing defects instead of the 
traditional "find and fix" mentality.
**** Overproduction
Producing more than is needed, or producing it
before it is needed. It is often visible as the
storage of materials.
**** Transportation
The unnecessary movement of parts between processes.
When you move material and parts between factories,
work cells, desks, or machines, no value is created.
**** Waiting
People or parts waiting for the next production step.
**** Inventory
All material, work-in-progress, and finished products
that are not being processed. Inventory beyond the 
bare minimum consumes productive floor space and delays
the identification of problems (if you've got plenty
of spares, there's no incentive to fix quality-related
problems). 
**** Motion
People or equipment moving or walking more than is needed
to perform the processing.
**** Processing
Overprocessing beyond the standard required by the customer.
This adds additional cost without adding additional value.
**** Underutilization of People
Underutilization of the worker's creativity and resourcefulness.
