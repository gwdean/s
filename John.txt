Notes on the GOSPEL OF JOHN (or just JOHN).

I. CONTEXT

[The author of JOHN seems to be addressing] not
so much Christians who need a deeper theology,
as non-Christians who are concerned about
eternal life and the way to it, and may be ready
to follow the Christian way if this is presented
to them in terms that are intelligibly related
to their previous religious interests and experience.
(Dodd 9)

It seems therefore that we are to think of the work
as addressed to a wide public consisting primarily
of devout and thoughtful persons (for the thoughtless
and religiously indifferent would never trouble to
open such a book as this) in the varied and cosmopolitan
society of a great Hellenistic city such as Ephesus
under the Roman Empire. (Dodd 9)
