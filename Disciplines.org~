* Disciplines
The core of White's Theory of Disciplines
can be found in the three diagrams on pages
355-357 of /Identity and Control/.

Each discipline is associated with a score
along three parameters:

- Involution       (INV)
- Dependence       (DEP)
- Differentiation  (DIF)

Each of the discipline examples have a 
score on one of the parameters: High,
Medium, or Low.

For example, within the INTERFACE discipline,
the /Battle-line units/ example score looks
like this:

- INV: High
- DEP: High
- DIF: Low

Whereas the /City-neighborhoods/ example
looks like this:

- INV: High
- DEP: High
- DIF: High

Interestingly, the /Functional department/ example
also scores High on all three parameters, but is
located within the ARENA discipline.
