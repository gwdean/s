* Overview
This document is an adaptation of the Logical Diagrams developed by
David Gray Carlson in his 2007 work on Hegel's /The Science of Logic/.

* Borromean Knot (18-26)
The "Game Dynamics" of the /SL/ are summarized by DGC using
a Borromean Knot Model.
** Three Circles
All middle terms (such as BECOMING) are made up of three circles.

First Circle  
- Emphasizes the Positive, Qualitative Side of the Diagram
- Leans to the Left Side of the Diagram

Second Circle (Right)
- Emphasizes the Negative Side of the Diagram
- Leans to the Right Side of the Diagram

Since negation always presupposes something to negate, the negative
moment is always a double, "dialectical" pairing.

The two dialectically opposed entities are reconciled by a
Third Circle, which contains a surplus (i.e. the whole is 
always greater than the parts). 

Third Circle (Middle)
- Contains material that exceeds what is provided by the two extremes. 
- This excess guarantees that the dialectic progress grows in complexity and sophistication with each step.



** Seven Areas
The three overlapping circles produce seven distinct areas.
- Areas 1,3,7 are static (no overlap).
- Areas 2,4,5,6 are dynamic (overlapping areas)
- Areas 2,5,6 are subject to 2 jurisdictions
- Area 4 is subject to 3 jurisdictions

The dynamic areas have "at least two natures--they are subject
to more than one jurisdiction."

Only Area-4 is present within every single step of the /SL/.
Later we will see that Area-4 is what Hegel calls "BEING-WITHIN-SELF".
** Four Agents (Modes of Consciousness)
Logic progresses via propositions about the middle term.
- Step 1: The Understanding Abstracts of the Immediate part of the Middle Circle
- Step 2: Dialectical Reason Remembers that the Supposedly was Mediated
- Step 3: Speculative Reason Intervenes to stop the "Modulating Nonsense".
- Step 0: Absolute Knowing Emerges after Steps 1-3 Iterate Many Times

More details of the Four Agents are described below.
*** The Understanding
*** Dialectical Reason 
*** Speculative Reason
*** Absolute Knowing

* With What Must Science Begin?
At the beginning of the /SL/, Hegel writes a short
essay entitled /With What Must Science Begin?/. This
essay "yields three lessons worth remembering" (DGC.39)

1. The /SL/ is to be a groundless logic, utterly free from presupposition

2. Deciding to begin at all is a contingent fact

3. Given that we have chosen to begin, PURE BEING is 
the best starting place, because it develops into the 
ultimate result--ABSOLUTE KNOWING--which then mediates
the beginning.

The Logic's true beginning is the Understanding's 
one-sided attempt to summarize the very last step of
the Logic--ABSOLUTE KNOWING. It cannot fix this
thought. Its attempt fails. The collapse of thought
is the modulation Hegel writes of.

The beginning of the Logic is a failure, and that's
what makes it a success.

* Personalizing the /SL/
One of the ways to grasp the /SL/ at first is to think of it
in terms of personalities of different consciousnesses.
DGC writes in such a way as to give the different steps in the 
/SL/ "personalities". We will do this from the "real" beginning
(chapter 27) up until True Infinity. This is 25 diagrams and 8
stages.
** Stage 0
"Being, pure being" with which the logic begins (or has begun)
is, in a sense, a more comprehensive concept than that of the
absolute idea at the beginning of the last chapter of the logic.
And yet the absolute idea also comprehends and at the same 
time exceeds what has been developed so far as to put itself
in the position of uniqueness that allows it to bring the
logic to an end. (Nuzzo-2005.191)


*** ABSOLUTE IDEA 
ABSOLUTE IDEA, the "speculative nucleus" of Hegelianism, is 
what remains after thinking (TRUTH) and doing (GOOD) abolish
themselves.

The TRUTH is that self-identical things pass away.

The GOOD is the obliteration of all obstacles to the creation
of a reality in which the subject is at home.

The TRUE GOOD is is the realization that ABSOLUTE IDEA has 
only itself as its obstacle.

ABSOLUTE IDEA is not the final step in the Logic. ABSOLUTE IDEA
must develop its moments of IMMEDIACY and MEDIATION.
*** IMMEDIACY
IMMEDIACY is Hegel's true beginning.

ABSOLUTE KNOWING "creates the world" by /reducing/ itself to
IMMEDIACY--an original sin which must of necessity lead to
the development of all the forms described throughout the /SL/.
 
*** MEDIATION
*** ABSOLUTE KNOWING (METHOD)
** Stage 1
*** Pure Being.(11)
*** Pure Nothing.(14)
*** Becoming.(15)
** Stage 2
*** Determinate Being
*** Quality and Negation
*** Something
** Stage 3
*** Something/Other
*** Being-for-Other and Being-in-Itself
*** Determination of the In-Itself
** Stage 4

*** Finitude
*** Limitation
*** The Ought
** Stage 6
*** Enriched Finite
*** Another Finite
*** Infinity
** Stage 7
*** Spurious Infinity
*** Spurious Infinity and Its Other
*** True Infinity

* True Infinity
Self-subsistence is the hallmark of True Infinity. The True Infinite
/ceases to be/ but /remains what it is/. (80)

** Overview
TRUE INFINITY is one of the most important concepts in Hegel's
philosophy. 

** 21 Steps to True Infinity
*** Pure Being (1a)
**** Type
- Type: Circle
- Id-1: Pure Being

**** Comments 
Pure light and pure darkness are two voids which are the same
thing. Something can be distinguished only in determinate 
light or darkness...

PURE BEING is /indeterminacy as such/.

In PURE BEING we think nothing. But this is what we would
perceive in a world of pure nothing. Hence, we might as
well say that PURE BEING is PURE NOTHING.

PURE BEING precludes an other that thinks. This means /you/,
among other things.

If PURE BEING were really here before us (and not just in
our thoughts) we would be obliterated--sucked into a very
black hole. The very fact that we are thinking at all
is proof that PURE BEING is not before us...PURE BEING
is never before us...it is apparent that PURE BEING has
already passed away.

We think, therefore PURE BEING has long since passed on.
This is a good thing, given our aversion to obliteration.
Self-conscious entities are much further along the road
than PURE BEING. Yet, we are the audience that witnesses
the unfolding of LOGIC.

What is "for us" is like a prologue in a Shakespeare play...the
audience can hear the prologue, but the players are oblivious.
Similarly, "for us", PURE BEING can be thought--here we
are doing it! But "for itself", PURE BEING will not suffer us
to contemplate it.
*** Pure Nothing (1b)
**** Type
- Type: Circle
- Id-1: Pure Nothing
**** Comments
PURE BEING is PURE NOTHING.

Since PURE BEING is self-identical, so is PURE NOTHING.

Thinking stands opposed to both PURE BEING and PURE NOTHING.
If you have a thought, you have already trafficked in
distinction, contrary to the premises of PURE BEING.

What could be more radically different from PURE BEING
than PURE NOTHING? Yet paradoxically, they are the same!

/NOTHING is, after all, SOMETHING./ NOTHING /is/--a paradox!

That NOTHING /is/--this paradox reflects the claim that 
there is no difference between PURE BEING and PURE NOTHING.
*** Becoming (1c)
**** Type
- Type: Borromean
- Id-1: Pure Being
- Id-2: Pure Nothing
- Id-3: Becoming (Determinate Being)
**** Comments
**** The Unity of PURE BEING and PURE NOTHING
**** Moments of BECOMING: Coming-to-Be and Ceasing-to-Be
BECOMING is concrete. It has difference within it [4,5,6],
but it is a unity (7).

**** Sublation of BECOMING
Coming-to-be and Ceasing-to-be are in motion.

If PURE BEING and PURE NOTHING are a contradiction, then
BECOMING "contains" the contradiction.

BECOMING has contradiction inside it (and hence "contains" it).

BECOMING, so long as it stays a fixed moment, prevents 
contradiction from blowing apart.

BECOMING has active parts and static wholeness. This contradictory
state of affairs means that BECOMING must disintegrate.

How can something move and stay put simultaneously? This
contradiction implies "the vanishedness of BECOMING."

* Being-Within-Self
Being-Within-Self, which is represented by the fourth
position in the Borromean Knot, /4/, is the "silent fourth". (67)

In the Objective Logic, /4/ represents the "alien substrate"
that is not part of Being. It is the /subject/, which is needed
to /complete the object/. (67)

Only /4/ is present in all steps of the /SL/. Later, we will
see that /4/ is what Hegel calls "Being-Within-Self". (18)

* The Antepenultimacy of the Beginning in Hegel's Logic
Philosophy must be self-grounding. It cannot start from
'givens'.

Presupposition is the enemy of science. Hegel's goal is
to develop a presuppositionless philosophy. He claims
to have succeeded. DCG and others seem to agree. This
article is DCG's defense of Hegel's claims to a 
presupposition-less philosophy.

DCG aims to defend this proposition:

"The last 'ultimate' step of the /Science of Logic/
is not the first step. Rather, the first step of the
logic is the /antepenultimate/ step-- the /third/
from the last-- in the /Science of Logic/ as a whole.

This argument addresses a question that has often 
bothered readers of Hegel:

- Where does difference come from?
- In the obliterative regime of PURE BEING, how can difference be accounted for?

Key points to DCG's argument:
Difference /IS/ pre-supposed, as Hegel's critics have alleged.

However, what is different (in BECOMING) is ABSOLUTE KNOWING--the ultimate
step, and PURE IMMEDIACY-- the antepenultimate step.

BECOMING summarizes the difference between these two-- /NOT/ the difference
between BEING and NOTHING as such. 

In other words, PURE BEING was /SUPPOSED/ to be ABSOLUTE KNOWING--the
Understanding's propositional summary of it. But it ended up being nothing
at all--a failure.

DCG's argument begins at the end--only by recalling the future may we
comprehend the past.

** Hegel's Last Chapter
Hegel's last chapter is called "ABSOLUTE IDEA".

Generally speaking, 'idea' is the negative unity of subject and object. Throughout
the last third of the /Science of Logic/--The Subjective Logic--the notion or 
concept (/Begriff/) theorizes itself. It produces an objective account of its
subjective self bu transporting itself from subject into predicate. This process
occurs in the chapter entitled SYLLOGISM, though perhaps this is better translated
as 'inference'. In effect, the subject /infers/ its own objectivity. Yet it finds
itself alienated from its self-inference and enters into a subject-object relation.

IDEA is the dynamic quality that both subject and predicate share: each on its own
logic has no right against the other. Each sacrifices itself on behalf of the other,
pointing to the other as the source of its being. IDEA is the common element of 
self-sacrifice-- the inability of any positivized concept to maintain itself
against its 'other'.

ABSOLUTE IDEA arises when both the TRUE (or thinking) and the GOOD (or doing) give
up their pretensions.

What ends up being true is that Kantian philosophy is a failure. The truth is that
there /is/ no thing-in-itself; it's just an illusion that passes away like any
other appearance.

The GOOD (or PRACTICAL IDEA) is the obliteration of anything that stands in the
way of the subject's freedom.

The true GOOD is the realization that the only obstacle to the subject's freedom
and self-knowledge is the very falsehood that the subject manufactured in theorizing
about itself.

The GOOD and the TRUE each sacrifice themselves: this commonality shared by
the TRUE and the GOOD is the ABSOLUTE IDEA.

ABSOLUTE IDEA is also called METHOD. 

METHOD is very, very negative. The METHOD is that all affirmative propositions
must obliterate themselves as inadequate to their own object. The /Science of Logic/
is thoroughly Spinozist in nature. For Spinoza, '/[d]eterminateness is negation./
[T]his true and simple insight establishes the absolute unity of substance.'

The difference between Hegel and Spinoza is that Hegel's substance is so
negative that it positivizes itself, only to dissolve its positive implication.

Like all concepts in the /SL/, the ABSOLUTE IDEA is put through the gauntlet
of three logical steps:

The Understanding (U)
- Makes immediate propositions
- Considers all encountered beings to be at peace, fixed, defined individual, and positive.
- Is static. (always leaves something out since Reality is ultimately dynamic) 

Dialectical Reason (DR)
- Is the critique of the Understanding
- Emphasizes the omitted materials that the Understanding has left out
- /Remembers/ the logical sequence that the Understanding suppresses
- For DR, "memory is the stuff that dialectical dreams are made of".
- DR, however, does not just negate a positive theory, but also positivizes the materials suppressed by U.

Specualative Reason (SR)
- Shows that the U and DR share an identity or a commonality as well as a difference.
- Their commonality /is/ their difference. (WORTH REPEATING TO DIGEST FULLY)
- The SR exploits this excluded negative (difference) 
- SR is constantly bringing this commonality to the fore.

The three-step process is then repeated. What SR produces
is 'interpreted' by the U. This interpretation is one-sided.
Once again, something further is left out, which generates
further steps in the Logic. The move from SR to U is always
retrogressive.

Advance is a /retreat into ground/.

Nevertheless, as the U interprets the material at hand, the
propositions of the U become more sophisticated as the Logic
progresses. By the time the U reaches the REALM OF ESSENCE, 
all of its propositions are negative and dialectical in nature.

In effect, the U transforms itself into DR.

By the time the U reaches the REALM OF NOTION, it sees things
speculatively, and thus transforms itself into SR.

The /SL/ ends when the U, DR, and SR coverge in ABSOLUTE IDEA.
Taken together, they are METHOD.

"SELF-SACRIFICE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE SUBJECT" is the very 'idea' of the /SL/.

To understand why self-sacrifice takes on a special meaning at the advanced
level of the idea, we can consider the very core of Hegel's system: the concept
of TRUE INFINITY.

*** TRUE INFINITY
A FINITE THING, by its own logic, /must/ come to an end.

When it does end, the FINITE THING has become what it OUGHT to be-- NOTHING.

Yet for Hegel, NOTHING is SOMETHING.

If the FINITE THING passes away, the memory of it remains.

The FINITE THING obtains an /ideal/ existence when it ceases to be.

It is ideal form, BEING is subject to /recollection/ (inwardization)

TRUE INFINITY is therefore the process of inwardization

TRUE INFINITY's place in the /SL/ is the very portal from /reality/ to /ideality/.

Ideality constitutes the memory of what /was/.

The TRUE INFINITE becomes what it ought to be--
but /it also remains what it was./

It is a /unity/ of its finite self /and/ its beyond.

The TRUE INFINITE constantly removes itself from self-presence to a beyond--/and/ it brings its beyond into its own presence.

This double movement of cancellation and preservation is called SUBLATION.
(or in Zizek's terms: the "chiasmic exchange of properties")

In sublation, the FINITE THING invests itself into the 
beyond when it ceases to be, and the
beyond invests itself into present thought
when /it/ ceases to be.

With the advent of ABSOLUTE IDEA, the very idea of a 'beyond' becomes untenable.

In ABSOLUTE IDEA, there is no longer a place to which the TRUE INFINITE can withdraw.
Here the distinction between form and content falls apart.

ABSOLUTE IDEA is absolute form.

ABSOLUTE IDEA must play out the three moments of the U, DR, and SR. Indeed,
these moments /literally are/ the U, DR, and SR. The moments identified in
the last chapter /are/ method itself--each one moment implying all the others
as well as itself.
*** True Beginning of the /SL/.
The first step in the analysis of ABSOLUTE IDEA is the antepenultimate step
of the /SL/ and, DGC contends, the true beginning for the /SL/. This is the
step of IMMEDIACY. It represents the Understanding as such.

The second step is MEDIATION--all the mediations there are. This is the
dialectical step in which identity is paired with difference. (Though
covertly, DR actually compares two /identities/.) The significance of
MEDIATION is that ABSOLUTE IDEA is revealed to be an active, dialectic
thinker that thinks itself. As such, it is PERSONALITY, something that
Hegel has declared to be missing from Spinoza's system.

Hegel contra Spinoza
- The ABSOLUTE cannot be a /first/. It must be the /result/.
- The CONCEPT thinks itself dynamically, and this means it is person-like.
- The highest, most concentrated point is the /pure personality/.

Personality implies LIFE, but also the COGNITION of being alive.

LIFE is IMMEDIATE IDEA. LIFE ends up standing for self-sacrifice.
There can only be life in general if individual lives terminate in death.

COGNITION is MEDIATED IDEA. It cognizes itself as LIFE and so too it sacrifices
itself.

This implies that ABSOLUTE KNOWING--the Ultimate Step--is, as negation of the
negation, the sacrifice of self-sacrifice. On its own logic, ABSOLUTE KNOWING
shows what it is when it /stops/ sacrificing itself and produces some 
positivized account of itself, and account in which /Geist/ aspires /not/ to
sacrifice itself.

In the very last step of the Logic, ABSOLUTE IDEA returns to immediacy as its
final act of self-manifestation. ABSOLUTE KNOWING is therefore the unity of
doing (or thinking) and being. It is divine creation--what Kant called 'intellectual
intuition'. What it /thinks/ truly /is/.

ABSOLUTE KNOWING is the ultimate step in the /SL/.

ABSOLUTE KNOWING is also the very last step in the /PhG/.

ABSOLUTE KNOWING stands for the realization that human consciousness is /not/ any
basis for scientific philosophizing. In effect, absolute knowledge 'ceases itself
to be knowledge'. It is also /all the knowledge there is/--that there is no knowledge.
There is only the appearance of knowledge.
** Hegel's First Chapter
The beginning of the /SL/ is simply the IMMEDIATE version
of ABSOLUTE KNOWING. It is what the ultimate step of ABSOLUTE
KNOWING, on its own logic, must produce.

The first step is thus not the ultimate 'speculative' step
or the penultimate 'dialectic' step, but the antepenultimate
step--the Understanding as such.

The following diagram shows the structure of the beginning in the
Science of Logic. In this diagram, the left side of the page is to be identified
with positivity. The right side of the page leans to negativity. The middle of
the page is positivity and negativity thought together. So conceived, abso-
lute knowledge can be portrayed as follows:

/INSERT PICTURE OF ABSOLUTE KNOWING/

Hegel's beginning is an immediate proposition about ABSOLUTE KNOWING:

/INSERT PICTURE OF HEGEL'S BEGINNING/

In the picture above, PURE BEING is shown to be a one-sided view of
all the knowledge there is. In effect, the concept, if it is to
know itself, must make a proposition about itself. It must say
affirmatively what it /is/.

This first thought of itself is a failure. It fails even to /be/
a thought, for:

'there is nothing, nothing in heaven or in nature or mind or anywhere
else which does not equally contain both immediacy and mediation, so
that these two determinations reveal themselves to be unseparated and
inseparable and the opposition between them to be a nullity.' (Hegel's words)

In this recollection, the motor of the logic--contradiction--cannot get
started. ABSOLUTE IDEA perpetually turns the ignition key of
Understanding and gets no result.

In an important, paradoxical way, Hegel's beginning /is/ a failure, but
Hegel makes his failure a success. 

The failure to have a thought /at all/ is the beginning of the /SL/.
Curiously, /non-thought/ is highly descriptive of ABSOLUTE KNOWING,
which is /no knowledge at all./

The Understanding paradoxically succeeds by failing. And in its failure
it anticipates the final result very presciently--all immediate
propositions must fail.

Although it sometimes said that PURE BEING is shown to be PURE NOTHING,
perhaps could be translated as 'PURE BEING and PURE NOTHING is the same'.

The indeterminate moments of BECOMING are not true moments: they 
cannot be concretely specified, since such moments "are always changing
into each other, and reciprocally cancelling each other."

We mortals /believe/ that BEING and NOTHING is nothing. It cannot suffice
merely to /believe/ that BEING and NOTHING is different. We must prove it.

Where does difference come from?

Difference precedes PURE BEING in origin. (213)

The identification (of difference) depends upon a viewpoint
that is able to comprehend absolute knowing standing over against its
initial, failed self-interpretation. According to this viewpoint, Speculative
Reason compares absolute knowing to the failed attempt of the Under-
standing to account for it. It perceives a vanishing of all thought into no
thought at all. All thought is different from no thought.

Simple immediacy is itself an expression of reflection and contains a ref-
erence to its distinction from what is mediated. This simple immediacy,
therefore, in its true expression is pure being... . Here the beginning is
made with being which is represented as having come to be through
mediation, a mediation which is also a sublating of itself; and there is
presupposed pure knowing as the outcome of finite knowing, of con-
sciousness. But if no presupposition is to be made, and the beginning
itself is taken immediately, then its only determination is that it is to be
the beginning of logic, of thought, as such. All that is present is simply
the resolve, which can also be regarded as arbitrary, that we propose to
consider thought as such. (HEGEL QUOTE)

/Why/ should we begin? At the beginning this is no means clear.
But by the end, we know that idea requires its own manifestation. It /must/
begin.

What pure being is different from is not pure nothing but pure knowing –
Logic’s ultimate step.

Thinking stands for absolute knowing, which, we know from
Hegel’s last chapter, has the active principle – personality. 

What is the truth is neither being nor nothing, but that being does not
pass over but has passed over – into nothing. But it is equally true that
they are not undistinguished from each other ... they are absolutely dis-
tinct, and yet that they are unseparated and inseparable and that each
immediately vanishes in its opposite. Their truth is, therefore, this 
movement of the immediate vanishing of the one in the other: becoming, a
movement in which both are distinguished, but by a difference which
has equally immediately resolved itself. (HEGEL QUOTE)

Hegel refers to movement between being and nothing. But strictly
speaking this movement has to be understood, not as the movement
between being and nothing, but as the movement from absolute
knowing (or active thinking) to being/nothing, its first failed proposition
about itself.

In short, it is the very nature of a beginning that it must fail; otherwise it
would be result – not beginning.

In spite of itself, PURE BEING refers
to something other than itself, and so as a beginning it is a failure. This
requires an over-arching perspective that can discern the difference
between ABSOLUTE KNOWING, on the one hand, and BEING and NOTHING, on
the other.

** Becoming as the True Beginning  
Being and nothing represents a recollection by absolute knowing of what it once must have
been. What becoming represents is all the Science of Logic ceasing to be in
the Understanding.

For Hegel, the modulation between being and nothing is not what
precedes becoming. What precedes ‘becoming’ is thinking which fails to
form a thought of its own being. Instead of contemplating its own being,
absolute knowing finds before it nothing at all. In thought it has ceased to
be.

The collapse of ABSOLUTE KNOWING is the beginning.

Becoming is absolute knowing itself, as it stands back from its own failed proposition, ‘learning’
from its failure that when it tries to think an immediate thought, it ceases to
be in that thought and is alienated from its product.

he ‘transition’ from pure nothing and pure being to
becoming should be viewed as a non-transition, since transition implies a
difference between origin and result. Hegel was aware of this when he
referred to the fact that ‘being does not pass over but has passed over – into
nothing.’73 Pure being and pure nothing are simply what becoming
implies.

** Conclusion
Hegel aims for a presupposition-free philosophy. Logic is a circle, as every
Hegelian knows. Yet movement in Logic is a ‘lumpy, bumpy triangular
wheel.’75 Logic progresses by dropping back and hazarding one-sided propo-
sitions doomed to fail in advance. This is just as true of Hegel’s beginning.
Pure being, which is pure nothing, is just such a retrogression. In the
methodical progress that Hegel describes, the beginning is a retrogression to
the antepenultimate step – the appearance of the Understanding, the faculty
of immediacy. Hegel’s beginning is a failure, and that is why it succeeds.

* Moves
57. Following Zizek, DGC argues that there is always a
"fourth" in addition to the triad of Understanding,
Dialectic and Speculative Reason. He compares it
to the dummy in a game of bridge--the silent spectator
that actually controls the game--a "Master Signifier"
or vanishing mediator that makes sense of all the other
signifiers.

* Finitude
When we say of things /that they are finite/, we
understand thereby that...finite things are not
merely limited--but that...non-being constitutes
their...being. Finite things...send themselves
away beyond themselves, beyond their being. They
/are/, but the truth of this being is their /end/.
The finite not only alters, like something in
general, but /ceases to be/; and its ceasing to 
be is not merely a possibility...but the being
as such of finite things is to have the germ of
decease as their being-within-self: the hour of
their birth is the hour of their death. (129)

DGC's interpretation of the above quote: We
think of ourselves as finite beings. We know that
we shall die. So death is already embedded within
us. Death is our Being-in-itself. We only await
our Being-in-itself to posit itself as actual.
At that point, life ends, and we shuffle off 
this mortal coil to encounter what dreams may
come.

For God, there is no time; birth is /simultaneously/ death.
God sees our lives as the constant modulation of BEING
into NOTHING. To God, we are born and we die in the
very same "hour". 

FINITUDE is negation "/fixed in itself/, and it therefore
stands in abrupt contrast to its affirmative."

BEING-FOR-SELF is an ironic portion of the /SL/.
The chapter takes up with a positivization
of the TRUE INFINITE, which is self-erasure
as such.

BEING is for-itself when it erases itself.

BEING-FOR-SELF is /form and no content/. Its
content is entirely outside itself.

*** Being-For-Self as Such
**** Determinate Being and Being-For-Self
Something is "for itself in so far
as it transcends otherness".

The FINITE once /was/, but it has
ceased to be; yet it is idealized, 
preserved in memory.

The Understanding grasps BEING-FOR-SELF
as "infinity which has collapsed into
simple being."
