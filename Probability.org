Probability is relatively recent, having emerged as a distinct mathematical
theory about 350 years ago. (xiv)

Theme 1. Thinking Probabilistically. One of the main purposes of the book is 
to help students to learn to think probabilistically. (Un)fortunately, 
the only way to achieve this is to learn the theorems of probability. As one masters the
theorems, the probabilistic point of view begins to emerge, even
as the specific theorems fade away: like the grin on the Cheshire Cat. (xiv)

Theme 2. Stochastic Processes. Probability can be regarded as the study
of random variables. Random variables never occur in isolation. They
invariably arise within a context. The contexts are the stochastic
processes. There are only a small number of major stochastic processes,
from which all of the major probability distributions arise. Thoroughly
understanding these processes and the relationships among them is an
essential part of learning to think probabilistically. Processes can
be combined and linked together to form other processes using mechanisms
such as compounding, randomization and recursion. By analogy with 
computer programs, we refer to these process combinations as
stochastic programs. (xiv-xv)

Theme 3. Reasoning Probabilistically. While processes permeate the 
entire book, probabilistic reasoning emerges gradually. The full
force of reasoning is felt in Chapters 5 and 6 on statistics and 
conditional probability. (xv)

Other Themes. (xv)
- Transforms as a by-product of randomization.
- Entropy, information and fundamental stochastic processes.
- Markov Chains as a versatile tool for modeling natural phenomena.
