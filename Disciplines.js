"Disciplines offer rules of the games that yield
coordination in tasks in an otherwise messy world."

"Our prototypical discipline is the INTERFACE
discipline, since that has been analyzed in depth
over the past three decades."

Interface Discipline
    - Valuation Order:  Quality
    - Process:          Commit

Council Discipline
    - Valuation Order:  Prestige
    - Process:          Mediate

Arena Discipline
    - Valuation Order:  Purity
    - Process:          Select    

Discipline > Interface
Discipline > Council
Discipline > Arena

Meals as Social Processes.
    - Sit-down urban dinner: Arena
    - Church supper:         Council
    - Cafeteria:             Interface

Any equation must sustain three very distinct variables;
the equation must be in contingency as well as in 
ambiguity and ambage. (71). [Deserves treatment
akin to that of information theory]

Invokes chapter 7.3.2, in which this approach is called
"Agency Calculus"
