Notes on Deming's /Some Theory of Sampling/. (1950)
* The Specification of the Reliability Required
** The Planning of Surveys
Sampling is the science and art of controlling and
measuring the reliability of useful statistical
information through the theory of probability. (2)

The statistician's aim is efficiency--the most 
information (smallest error) for the money. (3)

The requirement of a plain statement of what is wanted
(the /specification/ of the survey) is perhaps one of the
greatest contributions to theoretical statistics. (3)

A matured perpspective for the mathematical statistician
is best gained through several years' experience under
competent leadership, during which time his mathematical
reading and research are expected to continue (4)
