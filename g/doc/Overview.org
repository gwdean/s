This document serves as a "route-map" (I think)
of my general theory. The railroad theme is
appropriate.

Anyway, here are some of the basic themes that
I will be dealing with from a top-down perspective.

- Social Theory [[file:Theory.org]]
- Consciousness [[file:Consciousness.org]]
- Programming [[file:Programming.org]]
- Technical Writing [[file:Writing.org]]
- Network Analysis [[file:Networks.org]]
- Data Science [[file:Data.org]]
- Education [[file:Education.org]]

This general theory framework is intended to provide
thinkers better tools with which to think. I've 
spent a tremendous amount of time on all of these
topics, and I writing this to share what I have found
at the intersection of all of these various realms.
