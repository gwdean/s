* Plane
This document provides directions for
constructing the *MARKET PLANE* found
in Chapter 3 of Harrison C. White's 
/Markets from Networks/.

** Four Regions in Two Dimensions
Table 3.1
Cross-Tabulation of Parameters

                               Buyer Need         Producer Cost
Volume sensitivity             a                  c
Quality sensitivity            b                  d

The four regions:

ORDINARY -> Perhaps the most common. 
         -> Similar to microeconomic analysis.

ADVANCED -> Increasing returns to scale.
         -> Furthest from microeconomics.

TRUST      -> Increasing returns to scale.
           -> Involuting tendencies.
           -> Dealt with in later chapters.

UNRAVELING -> Dealt with in later chapters.

** Drawing the table.
There are a variety of market plane maps throughout
/Markets from Networks/. The prototypical market
plane map is found on page 52. We will use JavaScript
to make an interactive version of this map.
