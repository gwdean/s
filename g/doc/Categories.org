** Category of finite sets and maps
An *object* in this category is a finite set or collection.

(the set of all women in this room)           is one object
(the set of all desks in this room)           is another object
(the set of all 26 letters in the alphabet)   is another object

(1 2 3) is another object
(3 4 5) is another object
(3 2 1) is the same object as (1 2 3)

A *map* in this category consists of three things:
- a set /A/, called the *domain* of the map.
- a set /B/, called the *codomain* of the map.
- a rule, assigning to each element a in the domain an element b in the codomain.
