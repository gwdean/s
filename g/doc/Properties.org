* Properties
Properties are a set of key-value pairs associated with an entry. 

There are two main applications for properties (in org-mode)
- Properties are like tags, but with a value
- Properties can be used to implement (very basic) database capabilities

Properties can be conveniently edited and viewed in column view

Example of property syntax:

** CD Collection
*** Classic 
**** Goldberg Variations
     :PROPERTIES:
     :Title:     Goldberg Variations
     :Composer:  JS Bach
     :Artist:    Glenn Gould
     :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
     :NDisks:    1
     :END:

We can predefine publishers and the number of disks in a box:

** CD collection
   :PROPERTIES:
   :NDisks_ALL: 1 2 3 4
   :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Philips EMI
   :END:

If you want to set properties that can be inherited by any
entry in a file, use a line like

  #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4

Special properties provide an alternative access method
to Org-mode features.

The following property names are special and should 
not be used as keys in the properties drawer:

TODO TAGS ALLTAGS CATEGORY PRIORITY DEADLINE SCHEDULED
CLOSED TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP_IA CLOCKSUM BLOCKED ITEM
