** Tables
*** The bulit-in table editor
| Name  | Phone | Age |
|-------+-------+-----|
| Peter |  1234 |  17 |
| Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

You can create basic tables quickly like:

=|Name|Phone|Age|=

After this, pages 23-26 get into some advanced
keyboard moves for moving around a table, sorting
columns and rows, converting the active region
to a table, and other things along those lines.

Section 3.2 /Column width and alignment/ is 
technical and can be visited later.

*** Column Groups
This is a somewhat esoteric topic, but this section
includes an excellent table.

| N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
|---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
| / |   < |     |   > |       < |          > |
| 1 |   1 |   1 |   1 |       1 |          1 |
| 2 |   4 |   8 |  16 |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |
| 3 |   9 |  27 |  81 |  1.7321 |     1.3161 |
|---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------| 
#+TBLFM: $2=$1^2::$3=$1^3::$4=$1^4::$5=sqrt($1)::$6=sqrt(sqrt(($1)))

Pages 28-29 can be ignored for the time being.

** Hyperlinks
Worth spending a couple of hours/days mastering
this. There is a lot here, and a little summary
would not do this section justice.
** Time.org (Chapters 5-10)
Chapters 5-10 are all related to organizing 
oneself, and will be the subject of another
document called Time.org.
** Markup for rich export
*** Structural markup elements
**** Document title
The title of the exported document is taken from the line:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
> #+TITLE: This is the title of the document
#+END_EXAMPLE
**** Headings and sections
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
> #+OPTIONS: H:4
#+END_EXAMPLE
**** Table of Contents
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
> #+OPTIONS: toc:2       (only to two levels in the TOC)
> #+OPTIONS: toc:nil     (no TOC at all)
#+END_EXAMPLE
**** Paragraphs, line breaks, and quoting
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Great clouds overhead
Tiny black birds rise and fall
Snow covers Emacs
    -- AlexSchroeder
#+END_VERSE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler -- Albert Einstein
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_CENTER
I am being centered.
#+END_CENTER

**** Comment lines
# Lines starting with '#' in column zero are treated as comments
# and will never be exported.
*** Images and Tables
#+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next table (or link)
#+LABEL:   tbl:basic-data
| ... | ... |
|-----|-----| 
            
#+CAPTION: The caption for the next figure link (or table)
#+LABEL:   fig:SED=HR4049
[[./img/a.jpg]]

*** Literal Examples
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(define (yo x) (* x x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

For simplicity when using small examples, you can
also start the examples lines with a colon followed 
by a space.

Here is an example:
   : (define (yo x) (* x x))

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-xor (a b)
  "Exclusive or."
  (if a (not b) b))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
(save-excursion              (ref:sc)
   (goto-char (point-min))   (ref:jump)
#+END_SRC
In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position.
[[(jump)]][Line (jump)]] jumps to point-min.
