The following notes work out the details of Hegel's /Logic/.
* Being
** Being (11-19)
*** Pure Being and Nothing 
*** The Concept of Becoming
*** The Concept of Determinate Being and the Concept of Negation
** Quality (20-26)
*** Becoming and Determinate Being
The concepts of something and of something else are categories.
They are necessary concepts to get from pure being to determinate
being.
*** Something and Something Else
*** Bad Infinity
The concept of 'something' implies by necessity the concept of
'something else'. The two concepts limit each other. 

But just as the 'something' by necessity implies 'something else',
so the concept of 'something else' in-itself is a 'something'. That is,
it is a 'something else' only insofar as it is that which limits
the 'something'...this process can continue for infinity.

For Hegel, the above is a "bad infinity" because it is an endless
series of finite items, that is, items that, by necessity, are
finite and also, by necessity, must continue to the next item.

*** True Infinity
True Infinity is not a series that continues infinitely as a straight
line, but can be compared to the Infinity of a circle.

True Infinity is an infinity where a something implies a something
else; this something else, in turn, is seen to imply that very
something by which it was implied.

To see what this means, we can look at the concept of negation.
Each 'something' has positive value and corresponding negative
values. This involves each 'something' being not only that 
which it is, but also that which it is not. If a 'something' is
'A', then to be 'A' means to be that which is not 'non-A'.

However, if 'A' is 'something', then that which is 'non-A'
must be 'something else'. Therefore, 'something' is both
'A' and that which is not 'non-A'; and because not 'non-A'
is 'something else', it follows that 'something' is 
identical with 'something else': Their identity conditions
are interdefined.

Using the colors example, we can look at it like this.
If 'A' is red, then 'non-A' is the class of all other
colors. 'A' is only red insofar as it cannot be said
to be any other color. To say that it is red is to say
that the color it is, is none of the other colors. If
red were the only color, there would be no color
whatever. In order to be a color at all, any color
requires other colors with which it contrasts; if there
were no such other colors, no color name could have
any meaning.

To say that a thing is that which it is not is thus a
proposition whose truth is required as well from an
ontological point of view as from a logical point of
view.

The True Infinity has absorbed the finite. In themselves,
the 'something' and the 'something else' are finite, and
as long as their identity is not understood, they constitute
elements of bad infinity; but if their identity is understood,
it is understood that it is a negation of the negation--
understood that it is a self-negation and therefore a self-limitation--
then it is understood that they constitute elements of True Infinity.
*** Being-for-Self
True Infinity is a category because it applies by necessity
to whatever is. There is nothing which is not identical that
which negates it; their identity conditions are interdefined.

The wording is tricky here, so we will word it in a variety
of ways. 

Nothing could be anything but nothing if it was not determined
by the negative properties.

A less provocative way of expressing Hegel's statement would be
to state the claim that to possess a property P is to possess the
properties that negate non-P. P can only be P if there are 
properties belonging to the same class of properties as P, but
that differ from P. If this is not the case, P could no longer
be called a property.

The number 2 is what it is because it is the number between 1
and 3. It is the number 2 because it is neither the number 1
or the number 3 (among other things). The number 2 has the 
negative properties of being neither number 1 nor number 3.
These negative properties define the number 2. The number 2
is the negation of its negation.

Closely connected with the category of True Infinity
is the category of Being-For-Self. True Infinity concerns
(at least) two finite elements--the something and the
something else--regarding which, as soon as it is
understood that they are identical, it is seen that
together they constitute an infinite set. They constitute
a self-determined unity, a negation of negation: when we
negate the something, we get the something else, and
when the something else is negated, we get back to the
original, that is, to the something.

** Quantity (27-39)
*** Pure Quantity and Quantum
*** Continuity and Discreteness
*** Number
*** Extensive and Intensive Magnitudes
*** Quantitative Infinity
*** Measure
** Summary of Being (39-40)
Concept of negation is the foundation of Hegel's /Logic/

Negativity is a necessary condition for determination

Negativity leads us from pure being, and thus from nothing
and becoming, to determinate being.

Being is determined by having some quality.

*** Outer and Inner
** Actuality
*** Actuality and Reason
*** Modality, Possibility, Contingency and Necessity

* Misunderstandings (Houlgate-2006.266)
In this section, Houlgate describes some of the challenges
involved with understanding Being/Nothing/Becoming.
Hegel's account of pure Being is both conceptual and ontological.
The bare thought of being mutates into the thought of becoming.
Being turns out to be becoming. Pure Being does not vanish or come
into being /over time/, but instead pure Being proves to be 
/logically/ or /structurally/ unstable. In other words, it turns
out logically to be nothing but vanishing and becoming.

The task of the /Logic/ is not to describe temporal developments,
but rather to lay out before us all that being logically must be.
Logically, Being proves not just to be Being after all, but to
be Becoming; Becoming, accordingly, is nothing but the structural
instability that Being immediately proves to be. Sheer indeterminate
becoming is the same as being as utter instability.

In the /Logic/, Being and Nothing are initially pure and indeterminate,
but they soon prove to be much more determinate and complex than
mere /being/ and /nothing/ (or becoming). Being will mutate
logically into Reality, Being-Something, Actually, and ultimately,
Space, whereas Nothing, or the simple "not", will mutate into
Negation, Otherness, Negativity, and ultimately, Time. In each one,
however, Being and Nothing as such will be preserved. 

"Nowhere in heaven or on earth is there anything which does not 
contain within itself both being and nothing." (/SL/ 85/1:86)

Every further determination /of/ Being and Nothing will simply 
be a more complex and intimate interrelation /between/ Being
and Nothing.

The KEY to understanding Hegel's /Logic/ is to distinguish 
carefully what is true of Being /qua/ pure Being from what 
it is true of, for example, Being /qua/ reality or Being-Something
and to avoid reducing one category or determination of Being
to another. There will be structural affinities between such
determinations since less determinate ones are contained in
more determinate ones, but there will also be significant
differences that are not to be overlooked.

Sheer indeterminate Being (as opposed to determinate Being) is
logically indistinguishable from Nothingness. We can say of 
pure Being that it is identical to Nothingness because Pure
Being considered by itself is indeterminate. We cannot say
of finite things that they are just Nothing or that their
existence and non-existence are indistinguishable because
finitude has a determinate logical structure that is clearly
different from that of pure Nothingness.

Utterly /indeterminate/ Being is logically indistinguishable
from--though also irreducible to--sheer nothingness. Many 
people misunderstand Hegel fail to distinguish between the
logical character of pure Being as such and that of 
Determinate Being. 

When Hegel states that Being is in fact Nothing, he is not
denying that there is Being, but rather that insofar as
Being is utterly immediate and indeterminate, Being vanishes
logically into Nothing.

** Pure Quantity/ Quantum (28)

** Language Game Interdependence (29)

** The True is Both Subject and Substance (73)
Everything turns on grasping and expressing the true not only
as substance, but equally as subject.

** Concept (of Concept) (90)
Hegel's concept (of concept) contains three moments:
- Universality
- Particularity
- Individuality

** Substance, Reciprocity, Necessity, Freedom, I. (89-90)
From the concept of substance, to reciprocity, from there
to necessity, which implies freedom, which in turn implies the
I, we have the insight that substance is seen as identical
with subject. 

** The Concept of Freedom (89)
The concept of freedom is the key to understanding the concept
of the concept.

** Reciprocity (89)
Reciprocity is identical with the concept of the concept.
