* Notes on Wheat's Dialectics
"The now-almost-universal skepticism about
the idea that Hegel uses thesis-antithesis-synthesis
dialectics of a dynamic (nonstatic) sort
runs afoul of overwhelming evidence that 
Hegel does practice thesis-antithesis-synthesis 
dialectics.

Among the most powerful pieces of evidence are
Hegel's soon-to-be-revealed actual dialectics:

- 1 Overarching Dialectic
- 1 Preface Dialectic 
- 4 Table-of-Contents Dialectics
- 22 Microdialectics
- 10 History Dialectics

** Thesis-Antithesis Conceptual Pairs
1. Universal and Particular
1. One and Many
1. Union and Separation
1. Essence and Existence
1. Divine and Human
1. Inner and Outer
1. In-Itself and For-Itself
1. Potential and Actual
1. Unconscious and Conscious
1. Artificial (Man-Made) and Natural
1. God and Man
1. Father and Son
1. God in heaven and God incarnate
1. Abstract and Concrete
1. Theology (Revelation) and Philosophy (Reason)
1. God (Divine Ruler) and Monarch (Human Ruler)
1. Independence and Dependence
1. Freedom (from superstition) and Bondage (by superstition)
1. Truth and Falsehood
1. Natural (Physical) Law and Psychological (Mental) Law
1. Moral (Societal) Law and Natural (Personal) Impulses
1. Inner Law ("of the heart", personal) and Outer Law (societal)
1. Predator and Victim
1. Subject and Object
1. Internal (self) Approval and External (societal) Approval
1. Theory and Practice
1. Validity and Invalidity
1. Woman (family,divinity) and Man (state,humanity)
1. Divine Law and Human Law
1. Morality (moral law) and Human Nature (natural law)
1. Conscience and Morality
1. Identity (one) and Nonidentity (many)
1. Thought and Substance
1. One Ruler and Many Rulers
1. One Ruled Territory and Many Ruled Territories

** In-itself and For-itself
In-itself
- Universal
- One
- Unified
- Essence (if every particular)
- Divine
- "Inside"
- Spirit as a concept

For-itself
- Particular
- Member of Many
- Separate "object"
- Existence
- Neither divine nor human
- Visible exterior
- Material 

- In-itself :: Thesis
- For-itself :: Anti-thesis

The "in-itself" is an observed object's
inner essence; the "for-itself" is the
object's misleading outer appearance.

"In-and-for-itself" refers to the dialectical
synthesis, which combines (the best parts of)
the thesis and the antithesis. 

The word "mediate" is used to describe the
combining of a thesis and an antithesis into
a synthesis.

"In" is relatively easy to understand...it
refers to the "inner" core of the object, the
unifying concept (Spirit) found /in/ everything.

The "for" in "for itself" is less clear. One
way to think about it is as "for itself to see",
referring to the particularizing outer characteristics
of an observed object.

Again.

- In-itself  -> Thesis
- For-itself -> Antithesis
- In-and-for-itself -> Synthesis
