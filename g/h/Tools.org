Notes on /Tools for the Advancement of Objective Logic/. by William Lawvere (1994)

Thesis: The explicit adequate development of the
science of knowing will require the use of the
mathematical theory of categories.

The theory has has approximated a /particular/ model
of the general, sufficient as a foundation for a 
/general/ account of all particulars. Category theory
emerged in 1945 and has developed a variety of important
notions (adjoint functor, topos, closed category, etc.)
in order to provide:

A guide to the complex, but very non-arbitrary
constructions of the concepts and their interactions
which grow out of the study of space and quantity.

The subjective logic of inference between statements.
Here statements are of interest only for their 
potential to describe the objects which concretize the
concepts; here by describing, we mean both commenting
on the objects constructed and indicating desiderata
for their construction.

Specifically we need a mathematical model of the
following philosophical position. Within thinking:

- (a) Subjective logic is a part of objective logic, which also reflects and partly guides construction in the latter.
- (b) Thinking itself is a part of being, which reflects being and guides our action on it.
- (c) One of the many aspects of being is (b) itself, which is therefore reflected to manifest itself as (a).
- (d) Considered as a process within being, (a) is a central feature of thinking which a /science/ of thinking must address.

I believe that there is a second central feature of
thinking: individuals think, but so do clans, "schools
of thought",professions,social classes,nations,etc.;
thinking takes place in brains, but also in schools,
newspapers, meeting houses, etc.-- i.e., in material
institutions which people have created for the
purpose of mutually transforming individual thinking
and collective thinking into each other.

An explicit philosophy, dealing with both the mutual
transformation of subjective logic and objective
logic, as well as the mutual transformation of 
individual thinking and collective thinking, could
be very helpful (for example, when reforming the
schools) and adequate mathematical models will be
an essential basis of clarity.
