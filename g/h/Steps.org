* Logical Steps
** Introduction 
This document lays out the steps developed by David
Gray Carlson in his work on the /Science of Logic/ (SL). [fn:1]

According to Carlson, the "major contribution" of
his book is that "it reduces every move in Hegel's
logic to a discrete diagram." (4) 

In all, there are precisely 79 official logical
progressions, organized in groups of three.

Each official move is diagrammed in a "Figure". Thus
Figure 1(c) (Becoming) is the third sub-step of the
first step of the Logic.

There are a handful of "unofficial" steps in the Logic
used by Hegel and Carlson to clarify certain details
in the progression of the Logic.

The the terms referring to the official steps of the
Logic will be capitalized. 

Carlson uses the AV Miller translation as his main
source.

** Transitions
The descriptions of the transitions involved in 2a, 3a and 8a
are provided on page 104.

*** 2a: (-> 7 1) page 48. Understanding (as such)
This transition represents the Understanding's focus on
the IMMEDIACY present in the middle term (7).

*** 3a: (-> (4 5 6) 1) p.70. Mediation 
This transition represents the Understanding's focus on
the MEDIATION within the middle term.

*** 8a: (-> (4 5 6 7) 1) p.104. Speculative Reason
This transition represents the Understanding's focus on
the UNITY of IMMEDIACY and MEDIATION.
