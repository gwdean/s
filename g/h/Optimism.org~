* Optimistic Moments in Hegel's Philosophy
** Identity of Finite and Infinite Spirit (Lauer-1982.(132-137))
[F]inite spirit is a manifestation of absolue Spirit knowing 
itself as the totality of both knowing and the known. (132)

The consciousness which finite spirit has of objects as,
so to speak, over-against itself is but an aspect of its self-
consciousness, and this self-consciousness is but a facet
of the overall self-consciousness of absolute Spirit. (133)

Strictly speaking, finite spirit does not /have/ either
consciousness of objects or of itself; it /is/ finite
manifestation of infinite self-consciousness. (133)

Only as identified with absolute Spirit is finite spirit
what it itself really is. (133)

The initiative, so to speak, belongs to infinite Spirit,
whose self-differentiating in the totality of spiritual
activity is the very being of the infinite. (133)

The self-consciousness of infinite Spirit is the very
being of finite spirit. (133)
