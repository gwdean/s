* Five Theses
An identity in a human being need not constitute person, despite being
mirrored in the body and in the consciousness, in a mind. Minds fall
outside the scope of sociology as [HC-White] work(s) it here. And all
sorts of identities are bound up with what "control" is in social
surroundings. [White] expands on this in subsequent chapters around
the following five theses.

- Identities emerge from turbulence...
- Switchings are the vehicles of meaning for identity and control.
- Switching reckons in change both...
- Context gains in depth as identities embed into new levels.
- Context as dynamic patterns and control across levels...
