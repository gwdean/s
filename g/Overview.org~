This document serves as a "route-map" (I think)
of my general theory. The railroad theme is
appropriate.

Anyway, here are some of the basic themes that
I will be dealing with from a top-down perspective.

- Social Theory
- Consciousness
- Programming (used throughout)
- Technical Writing (used throughout)
- Network Analysis
- Data Science
- Education (focus on exposition/clarity/beauty)

This general theory framework is intended to provide
thinkers better tools with which to think. I've 
spent a tremendous amount of time on all of these
topics, and I writing this to share what I have found
at the intersection of all of these various realms.
