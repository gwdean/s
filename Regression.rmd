# Regression

These notes explain how to perform basic 
regression analysis in R.

## Simple Linear Regression
```{r}
# Simple Linear Regression
fit <- lm(weight ~ height,data=women)
summary(fit)

women$weight

fitted(fit)

residuals(fit)

plot(women$height,women$weight,
     xlab="Height (in inches)",
     ylab="Weight (in pounds)")
abline(fit)
```

## Polynomial Regression
```{r}
# Polynomial Regression
fit2 <- lm(weight ~ height + I(height^2), data=women)
summary(fit2)

plot(women$height,women$weight,
     xlab="Height (in inches)",
     ylab="Weight (in pounds)")
lines(women$height,fitted(fit2))

```
