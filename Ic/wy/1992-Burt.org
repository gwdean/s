* Structural Holes
** Introduction
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The structural hole is an element of social
structure simple in concept, powerful in 
describing empirical data, with integrating
implications for diverse lines of social
science theory.
#+END_QUOTE

The structural hole quality has four signature
qualities.

- Competition is a matter of relations, not player attributes.
- Competition is a relation emergent, not observed.
- Competition is a process, not just a result.
- Imperfect competition is a matter of freedom, not just power.

These four qualities are not individually unique to the
structural hole argument. They are jointly characteristic of it.

** Formalizing the Argument
** Turning a Profit
** Getting Ahead
** Player-Structure Duality
** Commit and Survive
