Notes on Chapter Six of /Markets from Networks/ (121-138).

This chapter looks at the competitive rather than
the complementary relations with other markets,
cross-stream rather than along the streams.

This chapter consists of the following subheadings:

- Boundaries: Porac's Case Study of the Scottish Knitwear Industry
- Quality Spread Within a Market
- The Two Faces of Substitutability
- Substitutability Parameter and Buyer Power
- *Feedback between Profile and Aggregate Production
- Las Vegas Paradigm

** Boundaries (122-124)
** Quality Spread Within a Market (124-127)
The crux of this section is captured by FIG. 6.1, from page 125.

There are six markets:

(hand high-fashion traditional-frame mid-market upscale mass)

Relationships between these markets are illustrated, based on the
data found in Porac-1995.

** The Two Faces (127-128)
** Substitutability Parameter and Buyer Power (128-130)
** Feedback (130-136)
This section contains the bulk of the mathematical analysis.

Step 1. Describe all the mathematical relationships.

*** Equation 6.3
TAU = V/W
V   = Total Aggregate Valuation received by Buyers
W   = Total Aggregate Market Revenue paid to Producers

TAU must be greater than unity for buyers not to balk

*** Equation 6.4
*** Equation 6.5
*** Equation 6.6
*** Equation 6.7
*** Equation 6.8
*** Equation 6.9
*** Equation 6.10
 
** Las Vegas Paradigm (136-138)
The description of Las Vegas on page 136-138 is a vivid account
of the style of analysis found in /Markets from Networks/.

- Let gamblers be the producer firms.
- The individual house is the market.
- The dealers correspond to the aggregate buyer in the W(y) model.
- (...to be continued...)
