Mathematical economics has "arrived"

At the time, mathematical economics is a "growth industry"

But it is not a new industry.

*** A Bit of History
Early "literary" economists (Smith, Ricardo, Say, Mill, etc.) largely
eclipsed by more sophisticated mathematical economists.

Cournot (1838) raised the bar on mathematical sophistication.

Cournot not only raised the mathematical level of analysis,
but also pioneered many concepts (e.g. demand function) now
common to both mathematical and literary economists.

Cournot's formulation of market phenomena is still in use 
today: competition, monopoly, oligopoly.

Cournot lay dormant for 30 or so years, until Jevons, Walras
in the 1870s and 1880s kicked off a round of innovation.

Marshall, Pareto, and Irving Fisher are some other big
names around this time.

*** Early Critics
Cairnes (1875) is a classic critique of the mathematical
economic program by an established "literary" economist.

*** The Variety of Uses
Although mathematical economics not longer has to fight
for its life, it is sometimes difficult to explain 
to outsiders.

One of the major uses of mathematics is in developing
and clarifying points of /economic theory/. Obviously,
those who have little use for any sort of theorizing
will not appreciate a tool to help in theorizing.

/Econometrics/ relies on mathematically formulated 
models of economic phenomena.

/Operations Research/, which involves a scientific
approach to decision problems faced by a variety of
organizations. (linear programming, inventory theory)
