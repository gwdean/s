A computational toolkit to help one understand philosophical concepts.
* Logical Diagrams (Carlson-2007)
** Introduction (1-5)
According to Carlson, the "main contribution" of his 2007 book is
that it "reduces every move in Hegel's logic to a discrete diagram".

In all, there are 79 official Logical progressions, organized
in groups of three.

Each official move is diagrammed in a "Figure". 

- Figure 1(c): the third sub-step of the first step of the /SL/. 
- Figure 2(a): the first sub-step of the second step of the /SL/.
- ...
- Figure 79(c): the third sub-step of the seventy-ninth step of the /SL/.

** With What Must Science Begin?
Three things worth knowing (DGC-39):

(a). The /SL/ is to be a groundless logic

(b). Deciding to begin at all is a contingent fact.

(c). PURE BEING is the best starting place, because it develops  
into the ultimate result--ABSOLUTE KNOWING--which then mediates
the beginning.

DGC argues that the Logic's true beginning is the Understanding's
one-sided attempt to summarize the very last step of the Logic--
ABSOLUTE KNOWING. It cannot fix this thought. Its attempt fails.
The collapse of thought is the modulation that Hegel describes.

The beginning of the Logic is failure, and that is what makes
it a success.
** Borromean Knot (18-26) 
*** Circles
All Middle terms (such as Becoming) are made up of three circles.

- Circle-1: Positive side (Left)
- Circle-2: Negative side (Right)
- Circle-3: Surplus of Positive and Negative (Middle)
*** Borromean Knot
These three circles together form a /Borromean Knot/, which 
contains seven distinct areas.

- Areas 1,3,7 are static.
- Areas 2,4,5,6 are dynamic.

Dynamic areas have at least two natures--they are subject to
more than one jurisdiction.

Area-4 is subject to all three jurisdictions.

Area-4 is what Hegel (eventually) calls "being-within-self"   
*** Modes of Consciousness
**** The Understanding
The Understanding is the intuition that perceives a concept
as an immediate, uncomplicated entity. (19)
**** Dialectical Reason
Dialectical Reason accuses the Understanding of ignoring
the negative component that dialectic reasoning is able
to comprehend. (21)

Dialectical Reason produces an autistic modulation
between two identical extremes that get us nowhere; drawing
attention to the lack in the Understanding merely replicates
the Understanding's own error.
**** Speculative Reason
Speculative Reason "wisely intervenes to stop the 
modulating nonsense". (23)

(...TO BE CONTINUED...)

*** Summary (26)
The Borromean knot represents Logic as a circle comprised of circles,
in accord with Hegel's comment from the /EL/:

Each of the parts of philosophy is a philosophical whole, a circle rounded and
complete in itself. In each of these parts, however, the philosophical Idea is
found in a particular specificality or medium. The single circle, because it is
a real totality, bursts through the limits imposed by its special medium, and
gives rise to a wider circle. The whole of philosophy in this way resembles a
circle of circles. The Idea appears in each single circle, but, at the same time,
the whole Idea is constituted by the system of these peculiar phases, and each
is a necessary member of the organization. /EL-15/ (DGC-26)

** Observations
*** Being-Nothing-Becoming
We begin with the simplest of simples--PURE BEING.

Hegel's opening words are: "/Being/, /pure being/, without 
any further determination." (SL:82) (No verb! Not even "is"!)

PURE BEING is immediacy /as such/, taken on its own terms
without reference to anything else.
**** Moves
***** DGC.(18-26)
***** DGC.(29-31)
In terms of our conventions, (2) is the voice of
Dialectical Reason. It is the suppressed voice of (1)
and hence immanent or implicit within (1). Dialectical
Reason merely expresses what was previously hidden.

Likewise, Speculative Reason is the voice of (4),
which is immanent to both (1) and (3). (29)

Every step contains (4), which implies that the prior
steps have never been entirely destroyed. Yet the very
idea of taking a step means that we have negated its
predecessor. Thus (1),(2),and (3) are expelled from
the middle term. Yet the middle term always implies
(1),(2), and (3) in the guise of (4),(5),(6). (29-30)

Sublation--denotes the destruction and preservation
of Logical moments by the more progressive moment
which it generates. (31)
***** DGC.(42)
Consider the phrase "the relation of /A/ and /B/."

(...considering....considering....considering...)

The remark refers to the parts (/A/, /B/) as well
as the relation itself. The "relation" is just as
separate a thing as /A/ and /B/ are.

Is the aforementioned relation complex or simple?
It is both.

BECOMING (1c) is just such a relation between 
PURE BEING and PURE NOTHING. (7) is simple, and
(4,5,6) is complex.

***** DGC.(46-49)
BECOMING--the middle term between BEING and NOTHING--
is concrete. It has difference within it (4,5,6),
but it is a unity (7).

Coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be are in motion. In
Figure 1c, (7) constitutes the equilibrium--the
unity at rest.

In the fourth official move of the /SL/ (2a), we take
the static part of BECOMING (7), and move it to
the left of the diagram (where the Understanding
resides). (48)

In Figure 2a, we take misshapen (7) and round it out
to (1). This represents the fundamental error of the
Understanding, which sees simplicity in lieu of
complexity. (48)

We contemplate Becoming /as if/ it were whole.

Figure 2a shows the transition to DETERMINATE BEING.
**** Comments
Abstraction turns Pure Being into Pure Nothing. The
modulation itself was Becoming.

Difference must precede Pure Being in origin. Hegel's
beginning is the Understanding's abstraction of 
immediacy from the last step of the Logic.

Reflection notices the difference between Pure Being/
Nothing and Absolute Knowing--an overarching perspective
that comprehends origin and pre-origin at the same time. (32)

*** Determinate Being
**** Moves
***** DGC.(55-57)
***** DGC.(57-58)
***** DGC.(63-69)
BECOMING is a oneness by virtue of of (7).

The /whole/ of BECOMING (4-7) is not a oneness.

Only from (7) does DETERMINATE BEING spring forth. (DGC-55)

(...to be continued...)
**** Comments
* Stepping to Infinity (Carlson-2007.(1-102))
** Step 0 Absolute Knowing (Method)
The /PhG/ ends when consciousness "abolishes itself
in favor of absolute or pure knowing". (DGC.10)

Absolute knowing is the /truth/ of every mode of
consciousness because, as the course of the /PhG/
showed, it is only in absolute knowing that the
separation of the /object/ from the /certainty of itself/
is completely eliminated: truth is now equated
with certainty and this certainty with truth. (49) (DGC.10)

The /SL/ takes up where the /PhG/ left off--with a 
purer immediacy than consciousness comprehends. (DGC.10)
*** Immediacy (595)
*** Mediation (598)
*** Absolute Knowing (Method) (599)
** Step 1 Becoming 
*** Pure Being (11)
PURE BEING is no /unity/ of distinguishable parts. It is
IMMEDIACY before there /are/ any parts to break it up. (DGC.10)

In the pure light of BEING, NOTHING can be distinguished. (DGC.11)

Pure light and pure darkness are two voids which are the
same thing. Something can be distinguished only in 
determinate light or darkness...[F]or this reason, it
is only darkened light and illuminated darkness which
have within themselves the moment of difference and are,
therefore, /determinate being/. (SL.93)

PURE BEING will require the darkness of PURE NOTHING
before it can be thought at all. (DGC.11)

PURE BEING is /indeterminacy as such/. (DGC.11) 

In PURE BEING we think nothing. This is what we would
perceive in a world of pure nothing. Hence, we might
as well say that PURE BEING is PURE NOTHING. They are 
/identical/. (DGC.11)

"Being, the indeterminate immediate, is in fact /nothing/. (SL.82)

If PURE BEING and NOTHING are the same, where does their
/difference/ come from? (DGC.11)

The origin of difference precedes PURE BEING. This is discussed
in the introductory essay to the /SL/ entitled "With What Must
Science Begin?" (DGC.11)

PURE BEING precludes an other that thinks. This means /you/,
among other things. (DGC.13)

If PURE BEING were really here before us (and not just in
our thoughts) we would be obliterated--sucked into a very
black hole. (DGC.13)

The fact that we are thinking at all is proof that PURE BEING
is not before us. Rather it is apparent that PURE BEING
/has already/ passed away. (DGC.13)

"For us", PURE BEING can be thought--here we are doing it! But
"for itself", PURE BEING will not suffer us to contemplate it. (DGC.13)

In the presence of PURE BEING, there can be no determinate
thing that thinks. (DGC.13)

*** Pure Nothing (14)
*** Becoming (15)
From the beginning, Hegel's logic is a play between (a) /stasis/,
(b) /movement/, and, in addition, (c) the unity of stasis and
movement.

Becoming is the first name of that unity.

Becoming represents /movement/. Movement can be perceived
only because it has as background the static, passive
non-movement of Pure Being and Nothing.

Becoming has a dual nature. It arises as the relation
between Being/Nothing and Absolute Knowing. As a relation,
it is /composed/ of simpler parts. It is a complex entity.
In its complexity, Becoming moves. But when we think of
Becoming as such, we freeze it, so that it does not move.

*** Quality and Negation (58)
*** Something (63)
** Step 3 Determination of the In-Itself
*** Something/Other (70)
*** Being-for-other/Being-in-itself (73)
*** Determination of the In-itself (78)
** Step 4 Limit (Determinateness as Such)
*** Constitution (79)
*** Constitution v. Determination (82)
*** Limit (Determinateness as Such) (83)
** Step 5 The Ought
*** Finitude (87)
*** Limitation (87)
*** The Ought (88)
** Step 6 Infinity
*** Enriched Finite (92)
*** Another Finite (92)
*** Infinity (93)
** Step 7 True Infinity
*** Spurious Infinity (94)
*** Spurious Infinity and Its Other (94)
*** True Infinity (97)
The Spurious Infinite and its finite beyond modulate
back and forth. The name of this movement is the
True Infinite.

True Infinity resembles, but is more advanced than,
Becoming.

The True Infinite is that which becomes something else
while remaining what it is. (97)

Hegel calls the True Infinite the "fundamental concept
of philosophy".

The contribution of the True Infinite is that it
encompasses both the Finite and its beyond.

In True Infinity, Limit (between the Finites) and 
Limitation (the Other of the Spurious Infinite)
are sublated.

Kant's doctrine of the thing-in-itself depends on
the self-identity of the phenomenal thing. Better
to let the Finite do what it does best--cease-to-be. (99)

The very act of ceasing /is/ True Infinity. (99)

True Infinity, "contradiction as displayed in the
sphere of being", is a higher reality than Determinate
Being. It has acquired a more concrete content and
therefore better deserves the name "reality".

A better word for True Infinity may be /ideality/. (100)
