* CATEGORIES
In Hegel's philosophy, the CATEGORIES constitute and define the ABSOLUTE. (5)

The CATEGORIES constitute, they are valid of and identify, SUBJECT and SUBSTANCE
equally. In other words, the OBJECT-IN-ITSELF is not unknown; it is known
because it is an OBJECT that is constituted by the CATEGORIES. (5)
 
The CATEGORIES identify, describe, and constitute both SUBSTANCE and SUBJECT.
Hegel's CATEGORIES are thus ontological CATEGORIES. They are CATEGORIES not
only for all thought, but also CATEGORIES for the world. This is why a
main thesis in Hegel's philosophy is that BEING and THOUGHT are IDENTICAL. (5)

The FORMS-OF-THOUGHT are, in the first instance, displayed
and stored in human language. Thinking is what distinguishes
man from other animals. In other words, it is through a study
of the logical structure of language that the CATEGORIES are
revealed or discovered. Through such a study the CATEGORIES
of the world are also discovered.
