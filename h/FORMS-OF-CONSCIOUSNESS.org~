* FORMS-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS
Is determined by the nature of the OBJECT-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS.

There is, for example, a difference between a consciousness
according to which objects are conceived as INDIVIDUAL
PARTICULARS and a consciousness according to which objects
are conceived as UNIVERSALS. Of necessity, we are talking
about objects, but the nature of objects is conceived 
differently. We are therefore talking about two different
FORMS-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS.
