* FORMS-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS (FORMS-OF-THOUGHT)
Is determined by the nature of the OBJECT-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS.

There is, for example, a difference between a consciousness
according to which objects are conceived as INDIVIDUAL
PARTICULARS and a consciousness according to which objects
are conceived as UNIVERSALS. Of necessity, we are talking
about objects, but the nature of objects is conceived 
differently. We are therefore talking about two different
FORMS-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS. (4)

The FORMS-OF-THOUGHT are, in the first instance, displayed
and stored in human language. Thinking is what distinguishes
man from other animals. In other words, it is through a study
of the logical structure of language that the CATEGORIES
are revealed or discovered. Through such a study the CATEGORIES
of the world are also discovered.
