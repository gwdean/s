** Relative Dates
You can specify a relative date by giving, as the
/first/ thing in the input: a plus/minus sign, a
number and a letter ([dwmy]) to indicate change
in days, weeks, months, or years.

With a single plus or minus, the date is always
relative to today.

The relative date feature can be used with the
following notations:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+0      => today
.       => today
+4d     => four days from today
+4      => same as above
+2w     => two weeks from today
++5     => five days from default date
+2tue   => second Tuesday from now
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Deadlines and Scheduling
DEADLINE
*** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
    The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]
    DEADLINE: <2013-08-15 Thu -5d>

SCHEDULED
*** TODO Watch Rams game 
    SCHEDULED: <2013-08-15 Thu> DEADLINE: <2013-08-15 Thu>

Inserting deadlines and schedules can be done using
some Emacs-fu along these lines:    
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
C-c C-d        Insert 'DEADLINE' keyword along with a stamp.    
C-c C-s        Insert 'SCHEDULED' keyword along with a stamp.
C-c C-x C-k    Mark the current entry for agenda action.
C-c / d        Create sparse tree
C-c / b        Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items before a given date    
C-c / a        Sparse tree for deadlines and schedules items after a given date
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Repeated Tasks
*** TODO Pay the rent
    DEADLINE: <2013-08-15 Thu +1m>

*** TODO Call Father
    DEADLINE: <2013-08-15 Thu ++1w>
    Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one week,
    but also by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
    the future. However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you
    called and marked it done on Saturday.
*** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
** Using the TODO feature
*** TODO figure out how this TODO system works
*** TODO 
*** TODO Plan trip to Philadelphia
